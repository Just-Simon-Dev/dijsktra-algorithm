# Dijkstra algorithm - introduction

This project is a visual implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm using p5.js library. The visualization allows users to understand how the algorithm finds the shortest path between points in a graph. p5.js was chosen for this project because it provides excellent tools for creating interactive and visual demonstrations in the browser.

## About the Project
In this visualization, you can:
- Observe how Dijkstra's algorithm works step by step
- Interact with the visualization using mouse and keyboard
- See the shortest path being calculated in real-time
- Learn about pathfinding algorithms in an interactive way

## Technologies Used
- p5.js - a JavaScript library for creative coding
- HTML5 & CSS3 
- JavaScript (ES6+)
